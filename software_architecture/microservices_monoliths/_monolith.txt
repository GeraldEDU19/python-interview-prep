=== MONOLITH ARCHITECTURE ===

DEFINITION:
A monolithic architecture is a software design pattern where all components of an application
are interconnected and interdependent, packaged together as a single deployable unit.
All functionality - user interface, business logic, and data access layer - are combined
into one large application that runs as a single process.

Think of a monolith like a traditional house:
- Everything is under one roof (single deployment unit)
- All rooms are connected through internal hallways (shared codebase)
- Utilities run through the entire house (shared database and resources)
- Changes to one room might affect the whole house (tight coupling)

=== KEY CHARACTERISTICS ===

SINGLE DEPLOYMENT UNIT:
- All application code in one repository
- Single database for all data
- One deployment process
- Shared runtime and resources

UNIFIED ARCHITECTURE:
- Direct method calls between components
- Shared libraries and dependencies
- Common build process
- ACID transactions across entire application

=== ADVANTAGES ===

SIMPLICITY:
✓ Easier to develop initially
✓ Simple deployment and testing
✓ Clear project structure
✓ Unified logging and monitoring

PERFORMANCE:
✓ No network latency between components
✓ Direct method calls (faster than API calls)
✓ Efficient resource sharing
✓ Single database transactions

DEVELOPMENT SPEED (EARLY STAGES):
✓ Fast feature development
✓ Easy code sharing and reuse
✓ Simple debugging
✓ Mature tooling support

=== DISADVANTAGES ===

SCALABILITY ISSUES:
❌ Must scale entire application
❌ Resource waste on underutilized features
❌ Single points of failure
❌ Limited horizontal scaling

DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES:
❌ Large codebase becomes complex
❌ Long build and deployment times
❌ Technology stack limitations
❌ Team coordination difficulties

DEPLOYMENT RISKS:
❌ Single bug affects entire application
❌ All-or-nothing deployments
❌ Difficult rollbacks
❌ Merge conflicts with large teams

=== WHEN TO USE MONOLITHS ===

GOOD CANDIDATES:
✓ Small to medium applications
✓ Small development teams (2-8 people)
✓ Startups and MVPs
✓ Simple CRUD applications
✓ Tight coupling between features
✓ Strong consistency requirements
✓ Limited operational expertise

AVOID WHEN:
❌ Large, complex domains
❌ Multiple independent teams
❌ Different scaling needs per component
❌ Mixed technology requirements
❌ High availability demands

=== MONOLITH PATTERNS ===

LAYERED ARCHITECTURE:
┌─────────────────────┐
│   Presentation      │ ← APIs, Controllers
├─────────────────────┤
│   Business Logic    │ ← Services, Domain
├─────────────────────┤
│   Data Access       │ ← Repositories
├─────────────────────┤
│   Database          │ ← Storage
└─────────────────────┘

MODULAR MONOLITH:
- Well-defined modules within single deployment
- Clear boundaries between modules
- Potential evolution path to microservices
- Domain-driven design approach

=== SCALING STRATEGIES ===

VERTICAL SCALING:
- Add more CPU/memory/storage
- Simple but expensive
- Has physical limits

HORIZONTAL SCALING:
- Multiple instances behind load balancer
- Requires stateless design
- Database becomes bottleneck

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
- Caching layers (Redis, Memcached)
- Database read replicas
- Connection pooling
- CDN for static content

=== MIGRATION TO MICROSERVICES ===

STRANGLER FIG PATTERN:
1. Route new features to microservices
2. Keep existing features in monolith
3. Gradually migrate functionality
4. Eventually replace monolith

EXTRACTION STRATEGIES:
- Start with least coupled components
- Extract by business domains
- Maintain data consistency
- Use feature toggles for safe transitions

=== BEST PRACTICES ===

CODE ORGANIZATION:
✓ Clear package/module structure
✓ Follow SOLID principles
✓ Implement dependency injection
✓ Avoid circular dependencies
✓ Separate concerns properly

DEPLOYMENT:
✓ CI/CD pipelines
✓ Containerization (Docker)
✓ Automated testing
✓ Health checks and monitoring
✓ Zero-downtime deployments

DATABASE:
✓ Proper indexing strategies
✓ Connection pooling
✓ Consider read replicas
✓ Plan for data growth

=== COMMON ANTI-PATTERNS ===

❌ BIG BALL OF MUD: No clear structure or architecture
❌ GOD CLASS: Single class with too many responsibilities
❌ SHARED DATABASE: Multiple apps sharing same database
❌ DISTRIBUTED MONOLITH: Services that must deploy together

=== TOOLS AND FRAMEWORKS ===

POPULAR FRAMEWORKS:
- Spring Boot (Java)
- Django/Flask (Python)
- Ruby on Rails (Ruby)
- ASP.NET (C#)
- Express.js (Node.js)

DEPLOYMENT:
- Docker containers
- Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Traditional application servers

MONITORING:
- APM tools (New Relic, Datadog)
- Log aggregation (ELK stack)
- Error tracking (Sentry)

=== DECISION CHECKLIST ===

CHOOSE MONOLITH WHEN:
□ Team size < 10 developers
□ Simple, well-understood domain
□ Need rapid initial development
□ Limited operational resources
□ Strong data consistency needs
□ Budget/resource constraints

EVOLVE TO MICROSERVICES WHEN:
□ Team grows beyond 10-15 people
□ Clear service boundaries emerge
□ Independent scaling requirements
□ Different technology needs per domain
□ Operational expertise available

=== CONCLUSION ===

Monoliths are not outdated - they're a valid architectural choice for many applications.
Key principles:

✓ Start simple with a well-designed monolith
✓ Focus on clean code and clear boundaries
✓ Monitor performance and team productivity
✓ Extract services only when there's clear business value

Most successful microservice architectures started as well-designed monoliths that
evolved based on actual business needs, not theoretical benefits.
