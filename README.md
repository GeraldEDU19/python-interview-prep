- **Behavioral Patterns** - Observer, Strategy, Command

### üèóÔ∏è Software Architecture (`software_architecture/`)
Architecture principles and patterns:

- **SOLID Principles** - Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
- **Clean Code Principles** - DRY, KISS, YAGNI
- **Database Principles** - ACID properties
- **Architecture Patterns** - Microservices vs Monoliths comparison

### üíª LeetCode Problems (`leetcode/`)
Common algorithm problems frequently asked in interviews:

- Two Sum
- Add Two Numbers
- Palindrome Number
- Roman to Integer
- Longest Common Prefix

### üéØ Interview Examples (`interviews/`)
Real interview scenarios and technical assessments:

- **Technical Consultant** - JavaScript and Python coding challenges
- Practical problem-solving examples
- Different difficulty levels (JS1, Py1, Py2)

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd leetcode
   ```

2. **Set up virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Explore the content:**
   - Start with `basic_concepts/` if you're new to Python
   - Review `software_architecture/` for system design interviews
   - Practice with `leetcode/` problems for coding interviews
   - Check `interviews/` for real-world scenarios

## üìñ How to Use This Repository
