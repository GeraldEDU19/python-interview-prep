=== UNIT TESTING THEORY FOR LLMs ===


Unit testing for Large Language Models (LLMs) presents unique challenges compared to traditional 
software testing. While classic unit tests check for deterministic outputs given specific inputs, 
LLMs often generate open-ended, probabilistic, or context-dependent responses. 
This makes designing effective tests and validation strategies especially important.

Why Unit Test LLMs?

1. **Reliability:** Ensures the LLM behaves as expected for critical use cases and edge cases.
2. **Regression Prevention:** Detects when model updates or prompt changes break existing functionality.
3. **Quality Assurance:** Helps maintain high standards for user-facing applications powered by LLMs.

Key Challenges:

- **Non-determinism:** The same prompt may yield different outputs on different runs.
- **Open-endedness:** There may be multiple valid answers for a single input.
- **Evaluation Difficulty:** Assessing correctness can require semantic or fuzzy matching, not just exact string comparison.

Best Practices and Strategies:

1. **Golden Set Testing:**
	- Maintain a set of input prompts and expected (or acceptable) outputs.
	- Use exact, partial, or semantic matching to validate responses.

2. **Parameterized Testing:**
	- Test the LLM with variations of prompts to ensure robustness.

3. **Automated Evaluation:**
	- Use string similarity, keyword checks, or even another LLM to evaluate outputs.

4. **Edge Case Coverage:**
	- Include ambiguous, adversarial, or rare prompts to test model limits.

5. **Deterministic Settings:**
	- Where possible, set random seeds or use temperature=0 to reduce output variability during tests.

6. **Human-in-the-Loop:**
	- For subjective or critical cases, include manual review as part of the test process.

Example Test Case Structure:

Prompt: "Summarize the following contract clause: ..."
Expected Output: Should mention payment terms and deadlines.
Test Logic: Check if the response contains key phrases like "payment" and "deadline".

Summary:
Unit testing for LLMs is about balancing automation with flexibility. While not all outputs can be 
checked with strict assertions, a combination of golden sets, semantic checks, and human review 
can provide strong quality assurance for LLM-powered systems.
