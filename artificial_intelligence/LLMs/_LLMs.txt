# LLMs AND AGENTS: CONCEPTS AND BEST PRACTICES

## DEFINITION:
Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Gemini are advanced AI systems trained to 
understand and generate human language. When combined with intelligent agents, they can 
perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals.
These agents can interact with users, access external tools or data, and adapt their 
behavior based on feedback.

Think of an LLM-powered agent as a smart assistant:
- The LLM is the "brain" that understands and generates language.
- The agent is the "body" that interacts with the world and manages tasks.

## CORE CONCEPTS

1. **INTELLIGENT AGENT:**
   - Uses an LLM to perceive, reason, and act.
   - Automates workflows, answers questions, or coordinates tasks.
   - Examples: Chatbots, document analyzers, process copilots.

2. **PROMPTING:**
   - Give instructions or examples directly to the LLM.
   - No retraining needed; fast and flexible.
   - Limited to the model's pre-trained knowledge.
   - Example: "Summarize this contract" or "What are the risks?"

3. **FINE-TUNING:**
   - Train the LLM further on a specific dataset or task.
   - Customizes the model for specialized domains.
   - Needs access to model weights and resources.
   - Example: Fine-tune GPT-4 on legal contracts for better clause extraction.

4. **RAG (RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION):**
   - Combines LLMs with external information retrieval.
   - Retrieves relevant documents, then feeds them to the LLM.
   - Useful for up-to-date or external information.
   - Example: Search a knowledge base before generating an answer.

## KEY DIFFERENCES: PROMPTING VS FINE-TUNING VS RAG

| Approach     | Customization | Data Access         | Use Case Example           |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Prompting    | None          | Model's knowledge   | Quick Q&A, simple chatbots |
| Fine-Tuning  | High          | Custom dataset      | Domain assistants          |
| RAG          | Medium/High   | External documents  | Doc analysis, research     |

## BUSINESS USE CASE EXAMPLE

**SCENARIO:** Document Analysis for Contract Review

A company needs to review contracts to find key clauses, risks, and obligations.

- **HOW AN LLM AGENT HELPS:**
  - Reads contracts automatically.
  - Extracts important sections (e.g., payment terms).
  - Summarizes findings for legal review.
  - Answers questions about each contract.
  - Flags unusual terms or compares clauses.

- **IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:**
  1. Prompting:  
     - "Summarize the key obligations in this contract."
     - "List any penalties for late payment."
  2. RAG:  
     - Integrate with a document database.
     - Retrieve relevant sections and provide them to the LLM.
  3. Fine-Tuning:  
     - Fine-tune the LLM on annotated contracts for better legal understanding.

**OTHER USE CASES:**
- Chatbots that answer customer questions using documentation.
- Process copilots that guide employees and automate steps.

## BEST PRACTICES SUMMARY

✓ Use prompting for fast prototyping and general tasks.  
✓ Use fine-tuning for specialized, domain-specific apps.  
✓ Use RAG when up-to-date or external info is needed.  
✓ Always validate LLM outputs in critical scenarios.  
✓ Combine LLMs with traditional software for robust solutions.
